I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2026.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3 Part 2

I enjoyed working with the Gregorian calendar because it is something that was actually useful in everyday life. The simple input-output with such a complex equation, combined with the challenge that including functions brought, made for a really fun lab.

Lab 6 Part 2

I grew up playing blackjack, so it was really cool to build a program that I could play blackjack with. The lab also taught me a great deal about arguments, which became very useful in later labs. The complexity of the lab made for a challenge, but it felt very rewarding to finish building it.

Lab 7 Part 1

The parking functions lab was really cool because it seems like the most practical one of the year. All the boolean functions taught me a lot of valuable lessons in tracing code, the lab definitely helped my problem solving skills a lot. At the end, when the function worked in its entirety, it was very enjoyable.
